## 10/18/2025 - I started the schematic on KiCAD for my Line Following Robot  

I'm new to designing PCBs, and have little experience with designing electronic circuits. I wanted to try out designing my first robot with PCB so it would be more compact and smaller. I have decided the components I'm going to use and I'm halfway through connecting the components together in KiCAD.![Schematic.PNG](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzE2OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--dd9284b433288468cd93c8645f4c3685fd7dbd8d/Schematic.PNG)
